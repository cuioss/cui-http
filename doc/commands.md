### Lessons Learned

**From root directory review:**
- Discovery: README.adoc demonstrates excellent balance between descriptive technical language and neutral tone
- Framework: Distinguish between factual descriptive language (verifiable claims like "comprehensive attack pattern detection") and promotional language (subjective claims without evidence)
- Impact: More accurate tone analysis that preserves legitimate technical descriptions while removing actual marketing language

**From doc/ directory review:**
- Discovery: All documentation maintains excellent technical tone with no issues
- Observation: Path reference styles vary (some use `../doc/` prefix, others don't) but all links work correctly
- Impact: Functional correctness prioritized over style consistency when both approaches work

**From doc/http-security/analysis/ review:**
- Discovery: Descriptive language like "comprehensive" can be FACTUAL when describing verifiable scope
- Framework: When analyzing tone, distinguish between:
  1. Subjective quality claims ("powerful", "best-in-class") - ALWAYS remove
  2. Factual scope descriptors ("comprehensive test coverage") - KEEP when verifiable (e.g., 246 tests, 395+ tests)
- Impact: Fewer false positives on legitimate technical descriptions

**From doc/http-security/specification/ review:**
- Discovery: Link verification correctly identified broken anchor references, but root cause (missing anchors in parent files) requires cross-directory analysis
- Framework: When reviewing specification subdirectories, verify parent directory files contain expected anchors before removing references
- Impact: Maintains proper requirements traceability across directory boundaries

### Known Issues

**Broken Anchor References (117 total):**

1. **doc/http-security/ → subdirectories** (71 broken anchors)
   - Target files: specification/specification.adoc, specification/testing.adoc, analysis/owasp-best-practices.adoc, analysis/cve-analysis.adoc
   - Expected anchors missing: _core_components, _architecture, _validation_stages, _a032021_injection, etc.
   - Action required: Review specification/ and analysis/ files to add missing anchor IDs

2. **doc/http-security/specification/ → parent directory** (46 broken anchors)
   - Target file: ../functional-requirements.adoc
   - Expected anchors missing: HTTP-1 through HTTP-17 (requirement IDs)
   - Action required: Add anchor IDs to functional-requirements.adoc for all requirement numbers

**Note:** All broken links are cross-directory anchor references. The files themselves are excellent quality - this is a structural documentation issue requiring anchor standardization across all HTTP security documentation.

### Recommendations

1. **Anchor Standardization:** Implement consistent anchor naming conventions across all requirement documents (e.g., `[#HTTP-1]` format)
2. **Pre-commit Validation:** Add hooks to validate cross-document anchor references before commits
3. **Documentation Standards:** Document explicit anchor ID conventions in project standards
4. **Cross-Directory Reviews:** When reviewing subdirectories with parent/sibling references, include related files in scope or explicitly flag dependencies
