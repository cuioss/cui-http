== Notes

=== Test Coverage

All LogRecords at INFO and WARN levels have test coverage except for:

- HTTP-103 (HTTP_FETCH_INTERRUPTED) - InterruptedException scenarios
- HTTP-107 (HTTP_PING_INTERRUPTED) - InterruptedException scenarios

These are documented in the LogRecord Javadoc but not tested due to the complexity of reliably triggering InterruptedException in unit tests.
