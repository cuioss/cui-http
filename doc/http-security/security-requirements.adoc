== Overview

This document defines the security-specific requirements for the HTTP Security Validation system. These requirements ensure the system effectively prevents, detects, and mitigates security vulnerabilities in HTTP input processing, with emphasis on OWASP Top 10 compliance and CVE prevention.

These requirements are derived from:

* link:analysis/owasp-best-practices.adoc[OWASP Security Best Practices]
* link:analysis/cve-analysis.adoc[CVE Analysis and Lessons Learned]
* link:specification/specification.adoc[Architecture Specification]
