/**
 * HTTP-specific result states that extend the basic CUI result pattern with semantics
 * tailored for HTTP operations, particularly ETag-aware caching and retry scenarios.
 *
 * <h2>State Overview</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #FRESH} - Successfully loaded new content from server</li>
 *   <li>{@link #CACHED} - Using cached content (ETag indicates not modified)</li>
 *   <li>{@link #STALE} - Using cached content but it may be outdated</li>
 *   <li>{@link #RECOVERED} - Succeeded after retry attempts</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ERROR} - All attempts failed, using fallback if available</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Patterns</h2>
 *
 * <h3>1. ETag-Aware Caching</h3>
 * <pre>
 * HttpResultObject&lt;String&gt; result = etagHandler.load();
 * if (result.isFresh()) {
 *     // New content loaded, update cache
 *     updateCache(result.getResult(), result.getETag());
 * } else if (result.isCached()) {
 *     // Content unchanged, use existing cache
 *     useExistingContent(result.getResult());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>2. Retry Flow Control</h3>
 * <pre>
 * if (result.isRecovered()) {
 *     // Succeeded after retries, log for monitoring
 *     logger.info("HTTP operation recovered after {} attempts",
 *         result.getRetryMetrics().getTotalAttempts());
 * } else if (result.getState() == ERROR) {
 *     // All retries failed, handle gracefully
 *     handleFailureWithFallback(result);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>State Semantics</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>FRESH</strong>: Content was loaded from server, ETag updated</li>
 *   <li><strong>CACHED</strong>: Server returned 304 Not Modified, content unchanged</li>
 *   <li><strong>STALE</strong>: Using cached content due to error, may be outdated</li>
 *   <li><strong>RECOVERED</strong>: Succeeded after 1+ retry attempts</li>
 *   <li><strong>ERROR</strong>: All retry attempts failed, using default/fallback result</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @author Implementation based on CUI result pattern
 * @see HttpResultObject
