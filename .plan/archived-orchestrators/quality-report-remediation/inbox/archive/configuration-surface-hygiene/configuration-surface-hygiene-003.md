# Parity test asserted only cross-preset consistency, so it passed on a uniformly wrong value

## Observation

CodeRabbit flagged the preset parity test for asserting only that the presets agree with EACH
OTHER, with no assertion tying any preset to its expected concrete value. A cross-preset-only
assertion is satisfied by every preset being wrong in the same way, so the test would stay green
through exactly the regression it exists to catch.

Remediated in-run — resolution `fixed`.

## Why it matters

A relational assertion without an anchor is a self-consistency check, not a correctness check.
The failure mode is silent: the test suite reports green, coverage reports the lines executed,
and nothing distinguishes "the values are right" from "the values are uniformly wrong". This is
the same shape as an index that lists only a subset — the artifact presents as complete.

## Corrective rule

When a test asserts a relation between N artifacts (parity, equality, ordering, round-trip),
anchor at least one side to a concrete expected value. "A equals B" needs "and A equals the
expected literal"; otherwise state explicitly in the test name that it is a consistency check and
add the anchored assertion as a separate test. Ask of any relational assertion: *what uniformly
wrong value would still satisfy this?* If such a value exists, the test needs an anchor.

## Candidate scope

Global — a testing-methodology rule, not project-specific. Overlaps the existing
`persona-module-tester` matched positive/negative control guidance; the orchestrator should check
whether it merges into an existing lesson rather than standing alone.
