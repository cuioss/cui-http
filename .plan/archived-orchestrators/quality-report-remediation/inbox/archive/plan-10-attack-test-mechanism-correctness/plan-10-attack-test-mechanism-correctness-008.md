# Candidate lesson: finalize loop-back ceiling (3) breached twice; operator authorised iterations 4 and 5

**Source signal**: work log WARNING 200d21 (loop-back ceiling breached) and decision-log WARNINGs 4c8151 and cb36f3. Found in the logs while checking the dispatcher's list.
**Component**: plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize (loop-back budget) and the plan's own authoring discipline (stale count prose).

## What happened

- Iteration 4: pre-submission-self-review found a stale "three things" count in the AllGeneratorsIntegrationTest class Javadoc. This plan introduced it in a7339f4, and a later loop-back fix made it wrong. The ceiling refused the iteration, so the operator authorised it and fixed it inline as a comment-only commit (1408d91).
- Iteration 5: CodeRabbit finding 7db6f7 (fixed-list generator discovery) came in after the ceiling. The operator chose fix-now and the fix landed inline in dfdc7ab.
- Overall: 17 tasks across 3 loop-back re-entries into 5-execute, plus 2 operator-authorised rounds over budget.

## Candidate rules

1. When a fix changes how many items an enumeration has, update every prose count of it in the same commit. Stale count prose is a known self-review class and cost a whole round here.
2. Hand-maintained fixed lists of generators or test families drift from their source. Derive them (TASK-015 and dfdc7ab both did this) instead of writing them by hand at authoring time.

## Classification hint

Mostly plan-authoring discipline (epic-local / cui-http test corpus); the ceiling-override handling itself worked as designed.
