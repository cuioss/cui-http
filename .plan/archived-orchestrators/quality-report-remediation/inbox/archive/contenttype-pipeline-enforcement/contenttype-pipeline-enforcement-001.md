# Candidate lesson: review bot re-litigates a settled, Q-Gate-confirmed plan decision

## Observation

During this plan's PR review rounds, CodeRabbit raised the SAME objection twice: that
`HTTPBody.isPlainText` should perform strict media-type matching instead of substring
matching.

Both times the objection contradicted a settled plan decision. Deliverable 5 of the
solution outline explicitly chose to KEEP substring matching, for consistency with the
five sibling predicates on the same type, and that choice had already been confirmed by
the Q-Gate. The second occurrence was not new information — it was the same argument
arriving again on a later review round, against a decision that had not changed.

## Why this is lesson-shaped rather than ADR-shaped

The `adr-propose` step judged it explicitly: there is no new architectural constraint to
record. The substantive design question was already decided and the decision is already
documented in the outline. What recurred is a PROCESS defect — the disposition of a
review-bot finding is not durable across review rounds, so a rejected finding can be
re-argued at no cost to the bot and at real cost to the run.

## Proposed rule (for the orchestrator to judge and place)

When a review-bot finding is dispositioned as `rejected` / `accepted-with-rationale`
against a settled plan decision, the rationale should be discoverable to the NEXT review
round on the same PR — either by posting the rationale as the reply on the original
comment thread (so the bot sees it in-thread) or by carrying the disposition forward so a
recurrence is recognised as a repeat rather than triaged from scratch.

The generalisable claim: **a settled plan decision needs a disposition record that
survives into subsequent review rounds; otherwise each round pays full triage cost to
re-reject the same finding.**

## Provenance

- Plan: `contenttype-pipeline-enforcement`
- Signal source: `signal_automated_review_count = 1` (review-bot findings remediated /
  dispositioned in-run)
- Deferred here deliberately by the `adr-propose` step.
