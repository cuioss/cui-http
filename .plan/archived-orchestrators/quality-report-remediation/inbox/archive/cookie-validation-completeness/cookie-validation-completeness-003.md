## Candidate lesson: the ci-complete precondition counts review bots as build checks, manufacturing a false `ci-verify-timeout` on a fully green build

**Component:** `plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize` (ci-complete precondition poll)
**Category:** bug / false-negative signal
**Observed:** plan `cookie-validation-completeness`, PR #231, this run.

### What happened

The first `ci-complete` precondition poll returned `ci_final_status: timeout`, naming
**CodeRabbit** as the sole failing (still-pending) check. At that same instant **all 22 genuine
build checks were already `SUCCESS`**. A re-poll a short while later settled the whole set
green with no other change.

### Why it matters

Recording that first result as `ci-verify-timeout` would have been a **false failure signal on
a fully green build**. Downstream that verdict is load-bearing: it can gate the merge barrier,
force a `red-ci-override` authorization the operator should never have been asked for, and land
in the run's metrics as a CI failure that did not happen.

The root cause is a category error in the poll's population: a **review bot** and a **build
check** are different kinds of thing on the same GitHub checks surface. A review bot's latency
is a function of the bot's own queue and rate window (CodeRabbit's own review-body output in
this run states `up to 1 included review per hour; 0 remain after this review`), not of the
build. Timing out the CI gate on it conflates "the code did not build" with "a bot has not
finished commenting yet" — and the pipeline already has a *separate* arm,
`plan-marshall:automatic-review` plus the re-review barrier, whose entire job is to wait for
review bots.

### Suggested direction (for orchestrator judgement)

Partition the checks population before computing `ci_final_status`:

- **Build checks** decide `ci_final_status`. A timeout here is a real CI timeout.
- **Review-bot checks** are excluded from that verdict and reported separately; the
  `automated-review` step and the re-review barrier already own waiting for them.

The recognized-reviewer-bot set is already derivable from the live registry — the same
derivation `manage-findings --preference-admissible` uses — so the partition needs no new
source of truth. Note that derivation can fail; the degrade should be *exclude nothing and
report the basis*, mirroring the `preference_admissibility_basis` pattern, so the partition
never silently becomes stricter than intended.

### Secondary note

Even without the partition, a single poll returning `timeout` should not be recorded as
terminal when the only outstanding check is a review bot. The re-poll settled it green here
purely because the operator retried, not because the pipeline required it.
