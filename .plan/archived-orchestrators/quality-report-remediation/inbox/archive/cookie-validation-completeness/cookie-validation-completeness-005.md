## Candidate lesson: a test comment asserting "this is actually correct per RFC 6265" pinned a fail-open security behaviour and is why the defect survived earlier review

**Component:** `cui-http` (`cui-http-core`, `de.cuioss.http.security`) — a repository-domain
finding, not a plan-marshall one.
**Category:** anti-pattern
**Observed:** plan `cookie-validation-completeness`, this run.

### What happened

`CookieTest.shouldHandleAttributesWithSpaces` pre-existed this plan. It **asserted a fail-open
security behaviour as CORRECT**, and carried the comment:

> This is actually correct per RFC 6265

That comment is the whole mechanism. A reviewer scanning the test sees a green assertion plus
an appeal to a named RFC, and stops. The defect survived earlier review not despite the test
but *because of* it: the test converted a gap into a documented, spec-blessed invariant.

### The anti-pattern, stated generally

**A test comment that cites a specification to justify a permissive assertion is a review
stop-sign, and it is load-bearing exactly when it is wrong.** Three properties make it
dangerous:

1. It is **unfalsifiable in place** — the citation names a document, not a clause, so nothing
   in the test can be checked against anything.
2. It **inverts the burden of proof** — the reviewer must go read RFC 6265 to disagree, which
   nobody does mid-review.
3. It **hardens on contact** — once written, the next person to touch the test reads it as
   established intent and preserves the behaviour.

### Suggested rules (for orchestrator judgement, targeted at the Java/CUI testing standards)

- **A spec citation in a security test must name the clause, not the document.** "RFC 6265"
  is not a citation; "RFC 6265 §5.2.1" is. An un-clause-anchored citation justifying a
  permissive assertion should be treated as an unsupported claim.
- **Fail-open assertions carry a higher burden than fail-closed ones.** A test that asserts
  input is ACCEPTED by a security validator is asserting the absence of a control; it should
  state which control it is deliberately not applying and why.
- **Grep-able audit:** in a security-validation codebase, test comments of the form
  "this is actually correct/expected/fine per <spec>" attached to a non-throwing assertion are
  a finite, enumerable set worth sweeping once.

### Routing note

This one belongs to the `cui-http` repository's testing standards
(`pm-dev-java-cui:cui-testing` / `pm-dev-java:junit-core`) rather than to plan-marshall.
Recorded here because the orchestrator holds the cross-plan context to decide whether the epic
wants a sweep plan for it.
