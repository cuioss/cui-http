# A symptom-scoped security audit re-finds the same defect class one layer deeper each round; only a closure question converges it

The finalize security audit on plan `exception-sanitisation-and-config-hygiene`
(epic `quality-report-remediation`) ran **five rounds**. Rounds 1-4 each found the
*same* defect class one layer further in, and each was a real defect at a real
call site — not a false positive, not a re-report:

| Round | Commit | The layer found |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | `7527c4` | `getMessage` rendered the detail unbounded while `toString` capped it at 200 |
| 2 | `f3787f` | `renderForDetail` **built and stored** the amplified string unbounded, so the exception retained it regardless of which renderer ran |
| 3 | `66c501` | `toString` rendered the `cause` field raw |
| 4 | `09aa35` | the three raw accessors carried no trust-boundary disclosure |

Every fix was scoped to the reported symptom, and the next round found the layer
beneath it. Four rounds of "fix what was reported, then ask again" produced four
more findings and no convergence signal.

## Root cause

The question driving rounds 1-4 was **"is anything left?"** — an open-ended
re-scan whose answer is bounded only by how hard the scanner happened to look.
It has no terminating condition, so a green round is indistinguishable from a
round that did not look far enough. Each round's fix also *moved* the boundary:
capping `getMessage` made round 2's stored-string defect the new outermost
symptom, so the symptom-scoped method was structurally guaranteed to find a next
layer without ever proving there was not one.

Round 5 converged only after being asked a **different** question:

> "Is the enumeration closed, and on what evidence?"

Answering it meant enumerating *every rendered field* of the exception and
checking each against the sanitisation contract — a finite, checkable set — rather
than re-scanning for whatever stood out. That produced a closure claim with
evidence attached, and the audit ended.

## Solution

When a security audit's second round finds the **same defect class** as its
first, stop re-scanning and change the question:

1. **Name the surface as a finite enumeration.** For a rendering/serialisation
   defect class that is every rendered field, accessor and renderer on the type;
   for an input-validation class it is every entry point; for a sanitisation class
   it is every sink.
2. **Check each member against the contract**, and record the enumeration itself
   in the audit output.
3. **Report closure with its evidence** — "these N members were enumerated, each
   checked against rule X" — not "nothing further found".

An audit that cannot name the set it covered has not proven closure; it has only
reported the absence of a further symptom it happened to notice.

## Impact

Applies to any multi-round audit of a single defect class, security or otherwise.
The tell is cheap and reliable: **round 2 finds the same class as round 1**. At
that point the symptom-scoped method has already been shown not to terminate, and
continuing it costs one round per layer with no bound on the number of layers.
