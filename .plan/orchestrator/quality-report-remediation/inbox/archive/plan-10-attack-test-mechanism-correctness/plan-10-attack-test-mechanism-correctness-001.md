# Candidate lesson: raw bidi control characters in Java test literals fail the Sonar gate (text:S6389)

**Source signal**: ci-verify red CI, loop-back iteration 1 (decision log bfc15f).
**Component**: cui-http-core test sources (attack generators / attack tests); pm-dev-java-cui:cui-http-testing guidance.

## What happened

`CookieChaosAttackTest.java:100` carried raw U+202E / U+202D (bidirectional override) characters inside a string literal. Local `verify -Ppre-commit` was green, but the SonarCloud quality gate failed on `new_security_rating` with rule `text:S6389` (bidirectional Unicode characters can hide source behaviour). Fix (commit 484282b): build the code points at runtime with `Character.toString(codepoint)` instead of embedding the raw characters.

## Candidate rule

Attack-pattern test data that needs invisible / bidi / control Unicode characters must construct them from code points (`Character.toString(0x202E)`, `"‮"` escapes are also flagged by some scanners) rather than embed them raw in source. The local pre-commit gate does not run the Sonar text rules, so this class only surfaces at CI.

## Classification hint

Possibly project-scoped (cui-http attack-database authoring) or a candidate for the cui-http-testing skill's adversarial-generator guidance.
