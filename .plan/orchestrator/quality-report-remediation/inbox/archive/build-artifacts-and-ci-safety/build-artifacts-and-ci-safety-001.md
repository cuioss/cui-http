# Verify a review bot's factual premise against the live artifact before acting on the finding

Two CodeRabbit findings on one PR asserted facts about repository state that were
false. Both were caught only because the implementer resolved the premise against
the real artifact before dispositioning the finding.

## Occurrence 1 — a path the bot named does not exist

CodeRabbit proposed a deploy gate checking for `original-jmh-result.json` at the
repository root. The file is actually produced under `data/`. Implementing the
suggestion literally would have shipped a gate that fails **every legitimate
run** — a permanently-red deploy step whose failures read as real regressions.

The implementer resolved the true path empirically from an actual benchmark
output tree before writing the check.

## Occurrence 2 — an asserted absence contradicted by the file

CodeRabbit asserted that the workflow's `allowed-endpoints` block contained none
of the `productionresultssaNN` hosts. Direct inspection of the live workflow file
counted **20** of them. The bot appears to have reasoned from an ADR prose
excerpt describing the block rather than from the block itself.

Accepting that assertion would have re-added entries already present — widening
an egress allowlist on the strength of a false absence claim.

## Rule

A review bot's statement about repository state — a path, the presence or absence
of an entry, a count — is a **lead, not a fact**. Before either implementing or
dismissing such a finding:

- Resolve any named path against a real produced artifact tree, not against what
  the name makes plausible.
- Re-read the live file the claim is about, and count. Accept neither a claimed
  absence nor a claimed presence on the bot's word.
- Record the verification in the finding's disposition, so a later reader can
  tell a checked negative from an unchecked one.

The asymmetry is what makes this worth a rule: a bot's wrong *opinion* costs a
rejected suggestion, while a bot's wrong *factual premise*, accepted, ships a
defect that presents as correct. Note also that both occurrences point at a
common bot failure mode — reasoning from documentation prose about a file instead
of from the file — so prose-derived claims deserve the check most.
