# Push freshness gate went stale on a finalize-internal commit; re-running the build beat the documented remedy

## Observation

The push freshness gate reported STALE not because anything was wrong with the build, but because
a **finalize-internal commit** advanced the worktree sha past the sha the last build was recorded
against. Nothing about the built artifact had changed in any way the gate cares about — the
commit was finalize's own bookkeeping.

The documented remedy for this state is a reconciliation record. In practice simply **re-running
the build** was cheaper AND strictly better evidence: it produced a real green result stamped at
the current sha, rather than a written assertion that the stale result still applies.

## Why it matters

A reconciliation record is a claim; a build result is a measurement. Where the two cost about the
same, the measurement is the better artifact — it cannot be wrong about the tree it ran on, and it
leaves a real result in the change ledger for the next freshness check to consume. The
reconciliation path exists for the case where re-running is genuinely expensive; treating it as
the default remedy trades evidence for prose at no saving.

## Corrective rule

When the freshness gate reports stale and the sha gap is a finalize-internal commit (no source
change), compare the two remedies on cost before reaching for the documented one: if a re-run
fits the remaining budget, re-run the build and let the fresh result close the gate. Reserve the
reconciliation record for a genuinely expensive re-run.

## Candidate improvement (for the orchestrator to judge)

Two candidate component changes, both worth weighing against the risk of weakening the gate:

1. The gate could classify the sha gap — a gap consisting solely of commits that touch no
   build-relevant path is a different fact from a gap that touches source — and report the
   classification alongside the stale verdict, so the caller can pick the remedy on evidence.
2. The remedy guidance could name re-running as the FIRST option with reconciliation as the
   expensive-re-run fallback, reversing the current emphasis.

Neither is a discipline the next agent can apply unaided; both are changes to the gate or its doc.
