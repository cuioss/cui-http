# Phase handshake drifted CLEAN because a Q-Gate finding was resolved AFTER the capture

# Observation

`phase_handshake` exited 1 with `status: drift` on `3-outline`. The cause was ordering, not
corruption: the handshake captured the phase's Q-Gate finding count, and a finding was then
resolved AFTER that capture, so at verify time the live count (0) disagreed with the captured
row (1). Recovery was a re-capture with `--override`.

## Why it matters

The drift was in the **CLEAN direction** — the phase got better between capture and verify — yet
it failed the gate identically to a dirty drift. That symmetry costs a recovery cycle on a
perfectly healthy phase, and it trains the operator to reach for `--override` reflexively, which
is exactly the habit that makes a genuine dirty drift get overridden too.

The deeper shape: the handshake treats a mutable count as an immutable capture. Resolving a
finding is a legitimate, encouraged action; the invariant should tolerate a monotone improvement
in the count rather than requiring the phase to be frozen between capture and verify.

## Corrective rule (for this run)

Capture the handshake AFTER all in-phase finding resolution is complete, not before. When drift
is reported, read the DIRECTION before overriding: a captured count strictly greater than the
live count is a clean drift and the re-capture is the correct response; a live count greater
than the captured one is real drift and warrants investigation, not `--override`.

## Candidate improvement (for the orchestrator to judge)

The handshake could distinguish the two directions itself — accept a monotone decrease in the
pending-finding count as a non-drift, or re-capture automatically in that case — so that
`--override` stays reserved for genuine disagreement. This is a component change, not a lesson
the next agent can apply by discipline alone.
