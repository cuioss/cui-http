# Outline deliverable declared an affected file its own change list never touched

## Observation

Q-Gate (phase `3-outline`, `scope_criterion_validator`) caught deliverable 2 of the
`configuration-surface-hygiene` outline declaring `SecurityDefaultsTest.java` with intent
`(write-replace)` while the same deliverable's own change list recorded **no edit** to that
file. The false declaration propagated: deliverable 3's stated "must run after D2" dependency
rationale rested on D2 touching that test, so the ordering rationale was false as well.

Slipped-then-caught within the run — resolution `fixed`.

## Why it matters

The declared footprint is consumed downstream by `manage-references` (declared-vs-realized
reconciliation), by the epic-level disjointness gate, and by task ordering. A file declared but
never touched is not a harmless over-declaration: it silently widens the plan's claimed surface
(blocking a sibling plan that legitimately owns the file) and it can manufacture a dependency
edge between deliverables that has no basis in the actual change list.

## Corrective rule

When authoring a deliverable's `**Affected files:**` block, derive each entry FROM the
deliverable's own change list rather than from the narrative intent, and re-read the two against
each other before the outline is validated. When a deliverable's ordering rationale cites another
deliverable's file, verify that file is present in that other deliverable's change list — a
dependency rationale is only as true as the footprint it cites.

## Candidate scope

Plausibly global (the rule is outline-authoring discipline, not project-specific), but the
orchestrator holds the cross-plan recurrence evidence needed to decide whether this is a
one-off or a pattern worth codifying.
