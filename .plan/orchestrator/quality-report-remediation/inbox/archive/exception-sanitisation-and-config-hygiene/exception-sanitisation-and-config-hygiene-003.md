# re_review_on_branch_cleanup cannot fire on a merge-queue repo, leaving a loop-back fix with no configured path to re-trigger a required bot

On a repo configured with `use_merge_queue=true`, the setting
`re_review_on_branch_cleanup=true` is **structurally unable to fire**, and the
combination silently produces a non-progressing merge loop.

## The mechanism

- **Trigger A** (`re_review_on_branch_cleanup`) is gated on branch-cleanup's own
  rebase advancing `HEAD`.
- The **merge-queue path deliberately skips that rebase** — the queue does the
  rebasing, so branch-cleanup has nothing to advance.
- Therefore trigger A's gate is never satisfied on a merge-queue repo. The setting
  reads as enabled and is inert.

Combined with `re_review_on_loopback=false`, a loop-back fix leaves a required
review bot permanently `participated_stale`: its last review predates the fix, and
**neither** configured trigger can re-request it. `pre_merge_comment_barrier=fail_into_loopback`
then loops the barrier without progress, because each pass re-observes the same
stale participation the previous pass could not clear.

The run only escaped because the orchestrator triggered `github_re_review`
directly, out of band — a manual step the configuration provides no route to.

## Solution

Options, in preference order:

1. **Add a merge-queue-aware trigger.** On `use_merge_queue=true`, key the
   re-review on the loop-back fix landing (a push advancing the PR head) rather
   than on branch-cleanup's rebase, so trigger A has a satisfiable gate.
2. **Make the dead combination visible.** `use_merge_queue=true` +
   `re_review_on_branch_cleanup=true` + `re_review_on_loopback=false` should be
   refused, or warned about, at config-validation time — an enabled setting that
   cannot fire is worse than an absent one, because it reads as coverage.
3. **Fail the barrier loudly.** `fail_into_loopback` should detect that it has
   re-observed identical stale participation across passes and escalate with
   "no configured re-review trigger can clear this", instead of looping.

## Impact

Every repo running `use_merge_queue=true` with a required review bot. The defect
is invisible in configuration review — all three settings are individually
sensible, and the interaction is only observable at merge time as a barrier that
will not clear.
