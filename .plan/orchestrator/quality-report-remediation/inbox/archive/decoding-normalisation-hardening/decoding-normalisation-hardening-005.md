# Two finalize step bodies ask a dispatched leaf to do what only the orchestrator can — each costs a round trip

## What happened

In plan `decoding-normalisation-hardening` (epic `quality-report-remediation`) two finalize
steps could not complete inside the envelope they were dispatched into, because their own
workflow doc instructs an action a dispatched leaf is structurally forbidden to take.

**1. `finalize-step-simplify` — a leaf-forbidden `Task:` dispatch.**
Work log shows the same workflow dispatched twice, four minutes apart:

```text
21:47:22Z [DISPATCH] ... workflow=plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize/standards/finalize-step-simplify.md
21:51:05Z [DISPATCH] ... workflow=plan-marshall:phase-6-finalize/standards/finalize-step-simplify.md
```

The doc's own Step 3 is literally `Task: plan-marshall:{target}` with an `instructions:` prompt
body. So the document is BOTH a dispatched workflow and a dispatcher — when the orchestrator
hands it to an `execution-context` leaf as the `workflow:` input, the leaf reaches Step 3 and
cannot fire it.

**2. `adr-propose` — a leaf-forbidden `AskUserQuestion`.**
Decision log, verbatim:

```text
(plan-marshall:adr-propose) ... Leaf cannot fire AskUserQuestion (execution-context dispatched
envelope) — returning escalate_ask with a prompt-required envelope for the orchestrator to
confirm the draft ADR title with the operator before create is called. No manage-adr create
call made in this turn.
```

Both steps eventually completed correctly (`finalize-step-simplify` → "no surplus structure
found", `adr-propose` → ADR-0017 created), but each cost an extra return-and-re-dispatch cycle.
The leaf behaved correctly in both cases — the return-to-orchestrator escape hatch worked. The
cost is structural, not a mistake by either agent.

## Rule

A step document must declare, in its own frontmatter, which execution tier it requires, and the
dispatcher must honour that BEFORE spawning an envelope:

- A doc containing a `Task:` dispatch or an `AskUserQuestion` is an **orchestrator-tier** body.
  It must not be passed as the `workflow:` input to an `execution-context` leaf; the orchestrator
  should run it inline and dispatch only the inner prompt.
- Where the operator interaction is conditional (`adr-propose` only asks when a
  decision-shaped change is found), the cheap fix is to keep the analysis in the leaf and have
  the leaf ALWAYS return the prompt-required envelope as a declared output, so the round trip is
  one planned hand-off rather than an aborted step re-fired from scratch.
- A lint over the step-doc corpus can catch this mechanically: any body reachable as a
  `workflow:` value that contains a `Task:` directive or an `AskUserQuestion` directive is a
  contract violation of the leaf topology.

## Impact

Two of thirteen finalize steps in this run paid a full re-dispatch. The pattern is generic to
the finalize step registry, so every plan in the epic pays it.
