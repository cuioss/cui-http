# A sequentially-allocated ADR number collides silently across concurrent PRs — git cannot see it

An ADR number was allocated against `origin/main` at authoring time, when the
highest existing record was 0018, so the new record became 0019. While the plan sat
in review, an unrelated upstream PR merged its own 0019 *and* an 0020. After a clean
rebase onto the updated main, both 0019 files sat side by side in the tree:

- no git conflict (the two records are different filenames in the same directory),
- no test failure,
- no lint or link error,
- a green build on a branch that would have merged a duplicate record number.

Only an explicit pre-merge re-check of "is my allocated number still free at the
current base?" caught it. The record was renumbered to 0021.

The general shape: **a monotonically-allocated identifier drawn from a scan of a
moving base is stale the moment the base moves, and the collision is semantic rather
than textual — so every mechanism that watches for textual conflict reports green.**
The same trap applies to any sequence-numbered artifact allocated by "scan the
directory, take max+1": migration numbers, changelog entries, numbered fixtures.

## Solution

- Re-verify sequence allocation at the **pre-merge barrier**, not (only) at
  allocation time. The check is cheap: re-scan the numbering namespace at the current
  merge base and assert the allocated identifier is still unique.
- Do not treat "rebased cleanly, tests green" as evidence of allocation freshness.
  A clean rebase is evidence about text, and this collision class is not textual.
- Where the numbering namespace is machine-managed, prefer an allocator that can
  detect the collision (a uniqueness assertion over the merged tree) to a
  convention that assumes serialized authoring.

## Impact

Any repository where several plans or PRs are in flight simultaneously and any
artifact class is numbered by directory scan. The failure is silent by construction,
so the cost of missing it is a merged duplicate that later readers must disambiguate
by hand.
