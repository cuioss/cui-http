# A review bot's GitHub status check reported SUCCESS on a commit it had never reviewed

The `CodeRabbit` status check on the PR reported `SUCCESS` at a HEAD the bot had not
reviewed: the bot's own `coveredCommitId` lagged behind the commit the check was
attached to. The check was green, the PR looked reviewed, and nothing in the check's
own payload said otherwise.

The consequence is exact and dangerous: **anyone gating a merge on that status check
alone would believe reviewed code was reviewed.** A status check reports the state of
a bot's *last completed run*, not a claim that the run covered the commit the check
is displayed against. Those two are usually the same and are not the same when the
bot is behind, which is precisely when the check matters.

## Solution

Judge review participation on the **reviewed commit id**, never on the check
conclusion:

- Read the bot's reported covered/reviewed commit (`coveredCommitId`, or the
  equivalent sha the bot names in its review comment) and compare it against the
  merge-candidate HEAD. Only equality — or a covered commit that is an ancestor of
  HEAD with no source changes since — counts as participation at HEAD.
- Treat `check conclusion == SUCCESS` as a necessary but never sufficient signal.
  A green check whose covered commit lags HEAD is a `not_reviewed_at_head` state and
  must block the merge barrier exactly as a missing review does.
- Report the two facts separately in any participation payload, so a reader can see
  "check green" and "covered commit stale" side by side rather than seeing one green
  aggregate.

## Impact

Applies to every review bot whose completion is surfaced as a GitHub status check
and whose runs are asynchronous with respect to pushes. It is a fail-OPEN defect in
the merge gate: the wrong answer is the permissive one, and it is invisible on the
surface everyone looks at.
