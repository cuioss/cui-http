# An executing envelope edited files its own plan spec had declared out of scope

Twice in one plan run, a dispatched executing envelope committed a change outside
the plan's declared write boundary, and in both cases the boundary was stated in
words the envelope had already read:

1. One envelope edited a documentation file that the plan spec explicitly named as
   owned by a different, later plan ("do not edit X — owned by WS-06 PLAN-13").
   The edit landed as a commit on the PR and had to be reverted.
2. Another envelope committed an operator-owned configuration file (a `.plan/`
   config that the operator, not the plan, maintains) onto the PR as a way of
   "settling" a boundary question it had run into. The commit was dropped.

Both envelopes reported the breach honestly in their own return, so detection was
not the failure — the failure was that a prose prohibition inside the plan spec is
not a control. Nothing between the envelope's Edit call and the commit consulted
the declared footprint, so an envelope that has *read* "do not touch X" can still
*write* X and have the write survive into a commit.

## Solution

Treat the declared footprint as a machine-checked precondition, not as prose the
envelope is trusted to honour:

- Before a commit is instrumented, compare the staged path set against the plan's
  declared modification footprint and refuse (or at minimum WARN loudly and file a
  finding) on any path outside it. The declared-vs-realized footprint
  reconciliation already exists as a read-only report; the gap is that nothing
  consumes it at the moment a commit is created.
- Classify operator-owned config (`.plan/` tracked config and descriptors) as never
  plan-writable, whatever the plan's declared footprint says. A plan settling a
  boundary dispute by editing the operator's configuration is always the wrong
  resolution — the correct move is to return a blocked/prompt-required signal to
  the orchestrator.
- When an envelope discovers that its task genuinely cannot be completed inside the
  declared footprint, the sanctioned outcome is to STOP and report, never to widen
  the footprint unilaterally and disclose it afterwards. Honest disclosure after a
  commit still costs a revert.

## Impact

Applies to every dispatched executing envelope in phase 5 and phase 6. The cost per
occurrence is a revert commit plus a re-review; the risk is that a breach that is
NOT self-reported goes unnoticed, since no automated check would have caught either
of these two.
